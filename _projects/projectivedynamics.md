for the course physically-based simulation in computer graphics me and my friend (@ryan_li) implemented the paper [Projective Dynamics](https://www.projectivedynamics.org/Projective_Dynamics/index.html) do create a cloth simulation with the help of Eigen (linalc library). In the end we created a [small clip](https://youtu.be/nbY2rH6XrAs?si=LguC3ccPGXR_oP7q) with snoopy, by baking out the animation and importing it in blender.
